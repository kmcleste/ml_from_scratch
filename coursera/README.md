<h1>Applied Data Science Capstone Project</h1>
<h3>This project is currently under development for the IBM Data Science Professional Certification course.</h3>
<body>
  The goal of the capstone project is to demonstrate ones ability to gather, prepare, process, and analyze real world data to drive business decisions.<br><br>
  The hypothetical story driving this project is as follows:<br><br>
  A Northeastern US business owner is looking to move operations to Toronto, CA. Said business owner has never had any dealings with Tornto or Canada in general
  and as a result, does not know the current market or location to start their new business. It is my job to compile a list of businesses types (i.e. gym, pizzeria, toy store, etc.)
  that would thrive in a given area.<br><br>The tools and API's that are being used are:<br><br><li>Foursquare API<li>Pandas<li>Numpy<li>BeautifulSoup<li>sklearn
  <li>Folium<li>Geopy<li>json<li>requests<li>Matplotlib
